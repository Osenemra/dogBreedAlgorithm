# dogBreedAlgorithm

This project aims to classify dog breeds based on their weight using the KNN algorithm. The dataset consists of dog breeds and their corresponding weights. The KNN algorithm is employed to predict the dog breed based on a given weight value.

You can consider incorporating additional features besides weight, such as height, age, or breed-specific attributes, to enhance the classification accuracy.
Parameter Tuning: Experiment with different values of "k" to determine the optimal number of nearest neighbors for classification.
